## The problem

We've been chatting too much, so we're only getting to one problem in this series!

### Sudoku validator

Determine if a 9x9 initial sudoku board is valid - that is the numbers on the initial state of the board reflect a valid sudoku puzzle. This puzzle doesn't need to be solve or be solvable, it just needs to be valid.

A complete sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid, made of 9 3x3 grids. Each 3x3 grid must contain the all numbers 1-9, and each horizontal and vertical grid of the 9x9 puzzle also must contain all the numbers 1-9.

An initial sudoku board has some of the numbers filled in, and the aim of the puzzle is to calculate what the rest of the numbers would be.

#### Example 1 - a valid sudoku board

#### Example 2 - an invalid sudoku board

In this board - the center horizontal line has duplicated 4s. The bottom horizontal line has duplicated 6s, and the center bottom 3x3 grid also has duplicated 6s.
